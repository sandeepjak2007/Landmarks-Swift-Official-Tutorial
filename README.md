# 🗺️ Landmarks – SwiftUI Official Tutorial

This project is a hands-on implementation of Apple’s official [SwiftUI Tutorial](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui), specifically the **SwiftUI Essentials** section.

---

## 📱 Overview

The **Landmarks** app is a sample iOS project built using **SwiftUI**, showcasing a list-detail UI pattern, map integration, and reactive data handling. It walks through essential SwiftUI concepts and components by building a functional, navigable app UI with static and dynamic content.

---

## ✨ Features Covered

### 🧱 UI Components
- `HStack`, `VStack`, and `List` for layout and content rendering  
- `NavigationSplitView` and `NavigationLink` for navigation  
- `Toggle` to manage view state dynamically  

### 🗺️ Map Integration
- Integrated **MapKit** using:
  - `Map`
  - `CLLocationCoordinate2D`
  - `MKCoordinateRegion`

### 📊 Data Management
- JSON parsing using a custom `load(_:)` function
- `@Observable` class to manage and share state
- Model structs conforming to `Codable`, `Hashable`, and `Identifiable`

---

## 📚 Concepts Practiced

- Declarative UI with SwiftUI  
- Navigation and state management  
- Working with external data and model decoding  
- Leveraging Apple frameworks: SwiftUI + MapKit  
- Clean separation of data and views
